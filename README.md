## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to create message pop-ups using css triangles. The trick is really the border-width and color;

```css
.pop-up:after {
  content: "";
  position: relative;
  inset-block-end: -73%;
  display: block;
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 0 40px 40px 0;
  border-color: transparent #fff transparent transparent;
}
```

### Continued development

I think I really need to know the ins and outs when it comes to triangles and thing but it turns out i suck a little so going forward i need to pay attention there.
